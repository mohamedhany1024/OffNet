This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.\nYou'll know that you have leaks when you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (PerfMon has nice memory counters). \nUnderstanding .NET's memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work \u2014 again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the e-book. Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A is registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. \nOf course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (red-gate ants profile, JetBrains dotMemory, memprofiler are really good choices, or you can use the text-only WinDbg and SOS, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).\nI believe unmanaged code is subject to its typical memory leaks, except that shared references are managed by the garbage collector.
